      <dc:description>Charles de Coster’s “The Legend of the Glorious Adventures of Tyl Ulenspiegel” first appeared in (in French) 1867, and is considered his masterpiece. This 16th-century romance on which he spend ten years wasn’t well-received in his motherland. However, it was translated in many languages and became popular outside Belgium. This translation is abbreviated to about the half of the length of the original. A full English translation was prepared a few years later, in 1922, by F. M. Atkinson.</dc:description>
