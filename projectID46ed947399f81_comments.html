<HTML><BODY>This is a translation (from French) of Coster's epic work The legend of the glorious adventures of Tyl Ulenspiegel in the land of Flanders & elsewhere, a retelling of the legendary Tyl Ulenspiegel stories, but now set in the context of the Dutch war of independence from Spain. The author combines the numerous pranks and jokes of this medieval character with the brutal realities of the Spanish inquisition in the Netherlands of the 16th century. 

<p>The longer translation by F. M. Atkinson is now also available in DP. This translation by Whitworth is abbreviated (but nicely illustrated). A Dutch translation is already available in PG: http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/11208.</BODY></HTML>
